# Xmartlabs Node.js Template
This project contains Xmartlabs' Node.js template.


## Contributing to this Template

Make sure you have the appropriate version of Node (20.9.0) installed.

Then install the required packages:

```shell
npm install
```

To run tests you'll need to create a `.env.test` file. You can simply copy the example file (`.env.example`) and rename it. You can check config.ts file for valid values. Before using the command to run the test, you'll need to start the docker container for the database use for testing, you can do this by using the command: 

```shell
docker-compose up db-testing
```

Tests are run using the typical command:

```shell
npm test
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Setup

* Install Node 20.9.0 (as documented on [`.node-version`](./.node-version))
* Install the appropriate version of npm: `npm i -g npm@10.1.0`
* Install packages with `npm install`
* Create a new `.env` file using the `.env.example` as an example. for that run `$ cp .env.example .env`.
* Set the variables in the new environment file `.env` you created above.
* Start the redis container with `docker-compose up redis-server`
* Start the project with `npm start`

## Project structure
* `.github` - GitHub Actions config files.
* `.vs_code` - Visual Studio Code sdebugger config.
* `build` - Generated with `tsoa specs-and-routes`. This is where it generates the routes and controllers documentation. Needed to run the code and generated on `npm start` and `npm test`. Added on .gitignore.
* `node_modules` - Contains all the dependencies. Generated with `npm install`. Added on .gitignore.
* `prisma` - Prisma migrations and schema. This is where all database changes should be made.
* `src` - Has the following structure:
  * `config` - Contains app envs, logging and error handling config.
  * `controllers` - Contains all the controllers.
  * `middlewares` - Contains auth, error handling,logging and security middlewares.
  * `queue` - Contains all queues. This is used to add tasks for the workers to pick up.
  * `routes` - Contains index and `/docs` routes. Remember that all controller routes are generated by `tsoa`
  * `services` - Contains all the services.
  * `tests` - Contains tests setup and utils.
  * `types` - Contains all the TS types and interfaces (except the ones generated by prisma client).
  * `utils` - Contains all the utils.
* `worker` - Contains all the workers that will run in another process.


## Prisma ORM
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-prisma) is a next-generation ORM for Node.js.
`prisma client` - Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript.
`prisma migrate` - Prisma migration system.
Requeriments:
* set a `DATABASE_URL` on .env - The format is specified in .env.example
* Running database: There's a docker-compose file example: `docker-compose up -d`
* Run database migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`

If you want to change the database schema, you just have to change the `prisma/schema.prisma` file and generate a new migration with `npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name`



## TSOA - Swagger docs and routes generation
[TSOA](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/introduction.html) is a framework with integrated OpenAPI compiler to build Node.js serve-side applications using TypeScript. It allows you to generate Swagger documentation and routes for your API.

### Generating Routes and Specs
To generate routes and specs (mandatory to run the project) a command (`tsoa specs-and-routes`) is needed and it's included in `npm start` and `npm test`.

### Decorators
TSOA uses decorators to define the API routes and docs. check out the [TSOA docs](https://tsoa-community.github.io/docs/getting-started.html#defining-a-simple-controller) for more info.

### Notes
* The security decorator acts as a middleware adding a `user` object to the request that contains the decoded JWT token (or whatever you put on the return of the function in `middlewares/auth.ts`).
* The class `ValidateError` (extends Error) is used by TSOA to handle validation errors. Ex: If there's a missing property in the request body. A `ValidateError` is thrown and the error is handled by the `ErrorHandler` middleware.


## Docker Configuration
A [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) has been added to this project. The main reason to use Docker is to generate a production build, it is not intended for use for development.
In fact, the Dockerfile has instructions only for generating the production-ready build. This is a multi-stage build that will build the project, run the migrations, and then run the server only with production dependiencies.

### BullMQ worker
* To add a new worker we just need to create a `new Worker()` object in the worker folder and pass a queue name to pick up tasks from.
* To schedule a new job in the queue we need to create a `new Queue()` object in the queue folder and pass it a queue name to schedule tasks in. Any metadata for the task should be pass as a JSON, e.g `queue.add('job_name', { ...params }, options);`.

### Rate limit
* To use express rate limit set the `ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT` env var to true otherwise rate limits will dependant on the nginx configuration.
* To add a new rate limit we need to create a new `rateLimit` object and then assign it to an endpoint e.g `app.use('v1/auth/register', rateLimit)`. For more info check out the [express-rate-limit docs](https://express-rate-limit.mintlify.app/overview).
